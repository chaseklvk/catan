## Notes
### Generating the board
The board is modeled as a hexagonal graph where each board space is a node and edges represent roads. This is done by first generating the individual board tiles. Each tile starts as a hexagonal subgraph with 6 nodes. Tiles are connected by merging four nodes together, two from each tile, effectively closing a "side" of each tile.
